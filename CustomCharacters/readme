Mostly resource for modders
- Stores strings for all registered PlayerClassDefinition and provides a function to get it. 
  If your mod somehow works with PlayerClassDefinition object of vanilla characters
  and you want to add support for non vanilla characters too, 
  you can iterate on the result of the aforementioned function.

- Adds support for creating new saves of custom characters
- Adds support for creating new PT3 characters (if PT3 is unlocked)

Installing Playthrough 3 mod isn't a requirement, the mod will still work.

Limitation:
    The mod will OVERRIDE the vanilla behaviour of pressing "New Character", skipping Bus Character Selection screen entirely.
