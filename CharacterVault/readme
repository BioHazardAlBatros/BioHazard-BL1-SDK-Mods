- Stores strings for all registered PlayerClassDefinition and provides a function to get it.

  you can iterate on the result of the aforementioned function.

- Adds support for creating new saves of custom characters in-game
- Adds support for creating new PT3 characters (if PT3 is installed)

Installing Playthrough 3 mod isn't a requirement, the mod will still work.

Warning:
    The mod will OVERRIDE the vanilla behaviour of pressing "New Character", skipping Bus Character Selection screen entirely.
